# Container Architecture Review Summary

## Architecture Detection
All feature scripts properly detect architecture using:
```bash
ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
```

## Architecture Support by Feature

### Full Support (amd64 & arm64)
- **Python**: Universal (builds from source)
- **Node.js**: Both architectures via official n tool
- **Ruby**: Both architectures via rbenv
- **Rust**: Both architectures via rustup
- **Go**: Both architectures with proper mapping
- **Java**: Both architectures (OpenJDK)
- **R**: Both architectures from CRAN
- **Docker**: Both architectures with proper URLs
- **AWS CLI**: Both architectures with specific URLs
- **Kubernetes tools**: Both architectures
- **Terraform**: Both architectures
- **Development tools**: Most support both

### Limited Support
- **Mojo**: amd64 only (checks and exits gracefully on arm64)
- Some specific tools may have limited arm64 binaries

## Key Patterns Used

1. **Architecture Detection**:
   ```bash
   ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
   ```

2. **URL Selection**:
   ```bash
   if [ "$ARCH" = "amd64" ]; then
       URL="...x86_64..."
   elif [ "$ARCH" = "arm64" ]; then
       URL="...aarch64..."
   fi
   ```

3. **Graceful Fallback**:
   ```bash
   if [ "$ARCH" != "amd64" ]; then
       log_warning "Tool only supports x86_64"
       exit 0
   fi
   ```

## Build Commands

### Standard Build (native architecture):
```bash
./build-all-features.sh
```

### AMD64 Build with Mojo:
```bash
./build-amd64-with-mojo.sh
```

### Cross-platform Build:
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 ...
```

## Testing
The test script (`test-all-features.sh`) works with any architecture and properly detects installed features.
