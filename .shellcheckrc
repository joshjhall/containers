# ShellCheck configuration for container build system
# See https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive for details

# Minimum severity level to report (error, warning, info, style)
severity=warning

# Shell dialect
shell=bash

# Only disable checks that are fundamentally incompatible with our architecture:

# SC1090/SC1091: Can't follow non-constant source paths
# We source files with dynamic paths (e.g., runtime loading of features)
# This is by design and unavoidable in our modular architecture
disable=SC1090,SC1091

# All other checks should be fixed in the code, not disabled globally
# Use inline '# shellcheck disable=SCxxxx' only with clear justification
