# Service: Exposes pods to network traffic
# Provides a stable IP address and DNS name for accessing pods
# Even if pods are recreated, the service IP/DNS remains the same

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: devcontainer
  labels:
    app: devcontainer
    component: development
spec:
  # Service type determines how the service is exposed:
  # - ClusterIP: Only accessible within the cluster (default)
  # - NodePort: Accessible on each node's IP at a static port
  # - LoadBalancer: Creates an external load balancer (cloud providers)
  # - ExternalName: Maps to an external DNS name
  type: ClusterIP

  # Selector determines which pods receive traffic
  # Must match the labels on your pods
  selector:
    app: devcontainer

  # Ports exposed by this service
  ports:
  # Example: Web application port
  - name: http
    # Port exposed by the service (what other pods/users connect to)
    port: 8080
    # Port on the container (what your app listens on)
    targetPort: 8080
    # Protocol (TCP or UDP)
    protocol: TCP

  # Example: Additional application port
  - name: api
    port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
    protocol: TCP

  # Example: Metrics port for Prometheus
  - name: metrics
    port: 9090
    targetPort: 9090
    protocol: TCP

  # Example: Debug port (like Python debugger, Node inspector)
  - name: debug
    port: 5678
    targetPort: 5678
    protocol: TCP

  # Session affinity (sticky sessions)
  # - None: Requests distributed to any pod (default)
  # - ClientIP: Requests from same client go to same pod
  sessionAffinity: None

  # Optional: External traffic policy (for NodePort/LoadBalancer)
  # - Cluster: Traffic can be forwarded to any node
  # - Local: Traffic only goes to pods on the same node (preserves source IP)
  # externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster

# Example: NodePort Service (exposes service on each node's IP)
# Useful for development when you don't have a load balancer
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Service
# metadata:
#   name: devcontainer-nodeport
#   labels:
#     app: devcontainer
# spec:
#   type: NodePort
#   selector:
#     app: devcontainer
#   ports:
#   - name: http
#     port: 8080
#     targetPort: 8080
#     # NodePort range: 30000-32767
#     # If not specified, Kubernetes assigns one automatically
#     nodePort: 30080

# Example: Headless Service (no cluster IP, direct pod access)
# Useful for StatefulSets or when you need to access individual pods
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Service
# metadata:
#   name: devcontainer-headless
#   labels:
#     app: devcontainer
# spec:
#   # ClusterIP: None makes it headless
#   clusterIP: None
#   selector:
#     app: devcontainer
#   ports:
#   - name: http
#     port: 8080
#     targetPort: 8080

# Example: LoadBalancer Service (creates external load balancer)
# Only works on cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Service
# metadata:
#   name: devcontainer-lb
#   labels:
#     app: devcontainer
#   annotations:
#     # Cloud provider-specific annotations
#     # AWS example: service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
#     # GCP example: cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
# spec:
#   type: LoadBalancer
#   selector:
#     app: devcontainer
#   ports:
#   - name: http
#     port: 80
#     targetPort: 8080
#   # Optional: Specify load balancer IP (if supported by provider)
#   # loadBalancerIP: "1.2.3.4"
#   # Optional: Restrict which IPs can access the load balancer
#   # loadBalancerSourceRanges:
#   # - "10.0.0.0/8"
